        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>
          I have a long history with the World Wide Web. It sounds mainly like
          the history most people from my age, background, and privilege have
          with it, so that will be something I share another time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've gone from having a PHP rendered site, to a CMS driven site, to
          blogs, to flat one-page sites, to JAM-stack sites and now have landed
          back on flat HTML/CSS pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through all of that, I picked up Markdown and started using that
          wherever I was authoring content. Markdown made sense for the most
          part. It keeps you focused on writing and basic structure, while
          ensuring you never wind up with malformed HTML. I generally avoided
          writing CSS whenever possible, accepting whatever defaults wiser
          designers chose for my websites.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "I'm not a journalist, my work isn't news, I'm not getting paid to do
          this, and I don't care to moderate incoming comments."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          However, I was getting bored with this. I found myself working on all
          of these experiments with JavaScript and JSON, looking for new ways to
          express ideas and share them. In the meantime, CSS was still sitting
          there largely unused by me. Even many designers I know have moved on
          from web design, CSS and all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing I realized was that blogging and social media posting
          are limited by design. I've been looking for ways to express my ideas
          in some form other than reverse-chronological. I also want to avoid
          authoring things with algorithms in mind. I'm not a journalist, my
          work isn't news, I'm not getting paid to do this, and I don't care to
          moderate incoming comments.
        </p>

          Finally, I've realized that while having the limits of Markdown may be
          helpful in some cases, they're not so helpful in others. When you're
          handing a website over to someone to maintain on their own without
          HTML/CSS knowledge, Markdown can be very useful. But if you're trying
          to experiment and continue learning HTML/CSS, Markdown can get in the
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also discovered the amazing CSS editing tools in Firefox! These
          tools make it easy to see your changes transition in real-time, as
          well as save your changes back to the original CSS files.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is a guarantee-free, experimental zone of ideas and pages. I
          may use JavaScript at some point or I may never add it at all. This
          may be the last post I write here or I may keep going for years to
          come.
