        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>
          My first Internet connection was what I'd inaccurately call
          "pre-dial-up." Let me explain: Dad had access to a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX">VAX account</a> through
          work and he let me use it. This was strictly a text-only command line
          thing. You could pull up email,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a>,
          and the World Wide Web which was available through
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)">Lynx</a>.
          Technically, I did access this VAX account through a dial up
          connection, but it wasn't a connection that would allow me to use a
          graphical web browser. It wasn't the kind of dial-up everyone
          associates with late-90s Internet access.
        </p>

          When I heard about Netscape Navigator 1.0, I was determined to figure
          out a way to download it. Somehow, I figured out a way to download a
          copy using the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_(protocol)"
            >Kermit protocol</a
          >
          and was able to get it on the PC. The connection to the VAX account
          didn't provide a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Line_Internet_Protocol"
            >SLIP</a
          >
          or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol"
            >PPP</a
          >
          connection, so that meant I wasn't able to pull up any websites
          through Netscape Navigator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Netscape still shipped with an "about" page and some other "help"
          pages. I did what so many other people did in those early days of the
          Web: I started to learn HTML by using View Source.
        </p>
        <p>
          A year or so later, we got a more typical dial-up connection, I got my
          own email address, and I started looking around. I made a website or
          two on GeoCities. They were pretty embarrassing. From what I remember,
          there was no content management system of any sort: you still had to
          write your HTML by hand. I think there may have been a template that
          came with your site to get you started, but that was it. Just you, a
          text editor, and some tacky animated GIFs from questionable sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Web continued on like this with plenty of "under construction"
          notices, mismatching fonts, and Flash animations. HTML tags were
          misused to "do" things, software vendors were moving faster than
          standards bodies could keep up, and AOL merged with Time Warner. I
          bought my own domain name and web hosting during my sophomore year of
          college. There are far worse things on which I could have spent $10/mo
          at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here until much later, HTML was a means to an end for me: you
          have to display your blog or web app somehow. I focused on databases
          and server-side technology, dipping into HTML and CSS only when it was
          absolutely necessary. Standards were still a mess, with competing web
          browsers rendering your page different ways.
