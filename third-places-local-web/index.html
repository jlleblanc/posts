        <h1>Establishing Digital Third Places in a Person-Centric Local Web</h1>
        <h2>Workshop description</h2>
        <p>
          The current World Wide Web is a collection of corporate-centric
          platforms where people are incentivized to generate and post
          attention-seeking content. Trust is low, misinformation is prevalent,
          and the volume is overwhelming. What if we built a high-trust,
          low-noise, person-centric, Local Web? Let's take a look at how we
          could build a Local Web of high-trust digital "third places" to serve
          friends, family, neighbors, and local organizations. We will discuss
          the values that a Local Web should have and also connect to an example
          server using standard web browsers.

        <h2>Values</h2>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          A Local Web is not automatically available to the entire public world.
          While you may join a Local Web through a public venue (e.g.,
          coffeeshop, non-profit organization, etc…), that venue may not
          necessarily receive everyone who attempts to join. You must be a part
          of a specific Local Web before accessing the data within it. Data
          within the Local Web is not published elsewhere.
        </p>
        <h3>Authenticity</h3>
        <p>
          Joining a Local Web should be a deliberate action. You should ensure
          the Local Web you are joining is authentic before presenting your name
          or profile. Similarly, if you are the steward of a Local Web, you
          should take care to only admit real people.
        </p>
        <h3>Self-Determination</h3>
        <p>
          Aside from a name, personal profiles should have no required data. The
          name given does not need to be a legal name. Also, the same person can
          use different profiles for different Local Web networks.
        </p>
        <h3>Impermanence</h3>
        <p>
          A Local Web is not intended for permanent publishing. Data that is
          available today may not be available tomorrow. People determine what
          data they wish to share with others and when they want to stop sharing
          it.
        </p>
        <h3>Decentralization</h3>
        <p>
          A Local Web should be made primarily of devices owned by individuals.
          While the establishment of a Local Web may need some level of
          centralized coordination (e.g., a conventional WWW site),
          communication should largely happen device-to-device. Local Webs
          should be independent of each other: one Local Web should not rely on
          the content shared in another Local Web.
