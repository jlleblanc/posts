        <h1>Establishing Digital Third Places in a Person-Centric Local Web</h1>
        <h2>Workshop description</h2>
        <p>
          The current World Wide Web is a collection of corporate-centric
          platforms where people are incentivized to generate and post
          attention-seeking content. Trust is low, misinformation is prevalent,
          and the volume is overwhelming. What if we built a high-trust,
          low-noise, person-centric, Local Web? Let's take a look at how we
          could build a Local Web of high-trust digital "third places" to serve
          friends, family, neighbors, and local organizations. We will discuss
          the values that a Local Web should have and also connect to an example
          server using standard web browsers.

        <h2>Values</h2>
        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
          Participants should feel welcome and included as they join a Local
          Web. As participants are welcomed to a Local Web, they should extend
          the same welcome and inclusion to others present. A Code of Conduct
          should be readily accessible and applied to everyone equally.
        </p>
        <h3>Self-Determination</h3>
        <p>
          Aside from a name, personal profiles should have no required data.
          Participants in a Local Web are free to represent themselves however
          they wish. The name given does not need to be a legal name. Also, the
          same person can use different profiles for different Local Web
          networks.
        </p>
        <h3>Authenticity</h3>
        <p>
          Joining a Local Web should be a deliberate action. Participants should
          ensure the Local Web they are joining is authentic before presenting
          their name or profile. Similarly, if you are the steward of a Local
          Web, you should take care to only admit real people.
        </p>
        <h3>Decentralization</h3>
        <p>
          Communication over a Local Web should happen directly between the
          devices of participants. While the establishment of a Local Web may
          need some level of centralized coordination (e.g., a conventional WWW
          site for directory assistance), Local Webs should be independent of
          each other. One Local Web should not rely on the content shared in
          another Local Web.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          A Local Web is not automatically available to the entire public world.
          While participants may join a Local Web through a public venue (e.g.,
          coffeeshop, non-profit organization, etc…), that venue may not
          necessarily receive everyone who attempts to join. Participants must
          be a part of a specific Local Web before accessing the data within it.
          Data within the Local Web is not published elsewhere.
