      <h1>Establishing Digital Third Places in a Person-Centric Local Web</h1>
      <h2>Workshop description</h2>
      <p>
        The current World Wide Web is a collection of corporate-centric
        platforms where people are incentivized to generate and post
        attention-seeking content. Trust is low, misinformation is prevalent,
        and the volume is overwhelming. What if we built a high-trust,
        low-noise, person-centric, Local Web? Let's take a look at how we
        could build a Local Web of high-trust digital "third places" to serve
        friends, family, neighbors, and local organizations. We will discuss
        the values that a Local Web should have and also connect to an example
        server using standard web browsers.

      <h2>Values</h2>
      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <p>
        Participants should feel welcome and included as they join a Local
        Web. As participants are welcomed to a Local Web, they should extend
        the same welcome and inclusion to others present. A Code of Conduct
        should be readily accessible and applied to everyone equally.
      </p>
      <h3>Self-Determination</h3>
      <p>
        Aside from a name, personal profiles should have no required data.
        Participants in a Local Web are free to represent themselves however
        they wish. The name given does not need to be a legal name. Also, the
        same person can use different profiles for different Local Web
        networks.
      </p>
      <h3>Authenticity</h3>
      <p>
        Joining a Local Web should be a deliberate action. Participants should
        ensure the Local Web they are joining is authentic before presenting
        their name or profile. Similarly, if you are the steward of a Local
        Web, you should take care to only admit real people.
      </p>
      <h3>Decentralization</h3>
      <p>
        Communication over a Local Web should happen directly between participants.
        While the establishment of a Local Web may need some level of centralized
        coordination (e.g., a conventional WWW site for directory assistance), Local
        Webs should be independent of each other. One Local Web should not rely on
        content shared in another Local Web.
      </p>
      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        A Local Web is not automatically available to the entire public world.
        While participants may join a Local Web through a public venue (e.g.,
        coffeeshop, non-profit organization, etcâ€¦), that venue may not
        necessarily receive everyone who attempts to join. Participants must
        be a part of a specific Local Web before accessing the data within it.
        Data within the Local Web is not published elsewhere.
      </p>

      <h2>Session flow</h2>
      <h3>Chat as people come in</h3>
      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Welcome, this is Establishing Digital Third Places in a
          Person-Centric Local Web. My name is Joe and I am facilitating this
          session today. I'm very excited to see all of you here now!</li>
        <li>
          I have just a couple of notes before we get started:
          <ol>
            <li>We are recording this session to make it available for review later on.</li>
            <li>We will have captioning turned on to make it accessible to everyone.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Introductions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>With that, we will get started with some introductions.
          <ul>
            <li>For introductions, please share your name, your pronouns, and your favorite place you regularly visit
              away from home.</li>
            <li>I will start with my introduction, then I will call on someone else to share their introduction, and
              then that person will call on someone else. We will go around until everyone has had a chance to introduce
              themselves.</li>
            <li>So now, I will start. My name is Joe LeBlanc, I use he/him pronouns, and my favorite place away from
              home is my local coffee shop here in Austin, Texas.</li>
            <li>Now let's hear from _____ and ____ when you are done, please pick the next person to share!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Thank you! I think that's everyone, did we miss anyone? ... Great!</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Third Places</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Thanks again for introducing yourselves and your favorite places! The places you shared are examples of
          "third places."</li>
        <li>The term "third place" is used by sociologists and urban planners to refer to a place that is outside of
          your home, school, or workplace that you visit on a regular basis.</li>
        <li>The "first place" is your home, the "second place" is your workplace or school, and "third places" are found
          throughout your town or city.</li>
        <li>Some examples of third places include
          <ul>
            <li>parks</li>
            <li>public squares</li>
            <li>cafes</li>
            <li>coffeeshops</li>
            <li>hairstylist shops (like salons and barbershops)</li>
            <li>houses of worship</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>These third places are vital for our social health for many reasons.
          <ul>
            <li>They give us a break from the places where we spend the majority of our time; a "home away from home"
            </li>
            <li>All are welcome: they introduce us to people we might not otherwise interact with</li>
            <li>They make it possible for us to be ourselves (ex. LGBTQ+ coffeeshop)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Digital Third Spaces</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>With the ongoing pandemic, we have been separated from many of our physical third spaces and have turned to
          digital ones.</li>
        <li>Here are some examples:
          <ul>
            <li>Message boards on platforms such as Facebook</li>
            <li>Group texts</li>
            <li>Video games</li>
            <li>Video chats, similar to the one were in right now!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Some of these digital third spaces have been well designed, while others have been put together hastily.
        </li>
        <li>Also, some of these spaces serve the profit interests of corporations more than our social well-being.</li>
        <li>We see this through the abuse of algorithms for advertising purposes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>My goals for this workshop</h3>
      <p>Given the current situation with digital third spaces, I have three goals for this workshop today:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Help you get the most out of the digital third spaces you are already a part of.</li>
        <li>Help you establish new digital third spaces that serve our social health.</li>
        <li>Recruit you to a Slack group to help me with a project I call the Local Web!</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>The Local Web is my early-stage project for making protocols and tools to establish new digital third
          spaces.</li>
        <li>It is driven by a set of values, which we will be discussing in breakout groups now.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Local Web Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The values of the Local Web project are centered around our social needs for inclusion and safety.</li>
        <li>Here are a few of the ones I've considered:
          <ul>
            <li>Welcome</li>
            <li>Self-determination</li>
            <li>Authenticity</li>
            <li>Decentralization</li>
            <li>Privacy</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Breakout Groups</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In a moment, you will get an invitation to join a breakout room.</li>
        <li>In this room, you will be discussing one of these five values.</li>
        <li>I am asking that in each group, one person volunteer for each of these roles:
          <ul>
            <li>Timekeeper: make sure the group is not running out of time</li>
            <li>Note taker: take notes on the discussion using ____ (hopefully Miro)</li>
            <li>Moderator: make sure everyone has a chance to participate</li>
            <li>Reporter: summarize takeaways and share for 1-2 minutes when we reconvene</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We should have 4-5 people per breakout group.</li>
        <li>If you find you have fewer than 4 people in your group, come back here to the main room where I can assist.
        </li>
        <li>However, please wait a full minute after joining the breakout to make sure everyone has had a chance to get
          in.</li>
        <li>Does anyone have any questions? ... Good! The breakout rooms are starting now and will run for ____ minutes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Questions for the breakout groups</h3>
      <p>
        Please use these questions as a guide for your discussion and reflections. You do not necessarily have to answer every question.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How have you seen this value in any of the digital third spaces you are a part of?</li>
        <li>How could your current digital third spaces be improved by this value?</li>
        <li>What are some of the challenges with implementing this value?</li>
        <li>How do corporation-owned platforms (e.g. Facebook, TikTok) help or hinder this value?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Regroup</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Alright everyone, welcome back! If your group is still summarizing, let me know and we can have another
          group report while you are finishing up.</li>
        <li>Let's start with Group 1...</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Thank you everyone for participating and discussing Local Web values. I hope you leave today with some valuable
        takeaways as you participate in and establish your own digital third spaces.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in participating in my project to build values-driven tools and protocols for establishing
        digital third spaces, please join my Slack group! I am posting the invitation link here in the chat and I will
        be available around MozFest as well! Thanks again!</p>
