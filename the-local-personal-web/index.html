        <h1>The Local Personal Web</h1>
        <p>
          Computing power has always swung between shared and personal. Consider
          the trends of these decades:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="decade">1970s:</span> üóÑ mainframes (shared)</li>
          <li>
            <span class="decade">1980s:</span> üñ• personal computers (personal)
          </li>
          <li><span class="decade">1990s:</span> üåé World Wide Web (shared)</li>
          <li><span class="decade">2000s:</span> üì± smartphones (personal)</li>
          <li>
            <span class="decade">2010s:</span> ‚òÅÔ∏è cloud platforms (shared)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <span class="decade">2010s</span> did not merely introduce shared
          cloud platforms. It made them an everyday part of the way people shop,
          work, travel, and socialize. Cloud platforms in turn suburbanized the
          web, separating each of these activities into single-use properties
          shared among millions of strangers.
        </p>
        <p>
          People are beginning to speak up about the abuses of Big Tech cloud
          platforms. Governments are passing legislation in an attempt to
          regulate their activity. The Internet itself is getting slower with so
          many people working and learning remotely.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a decade of cloud platform dominance, we are ready for something
          new. Here at the beginning of the <span class="decade">2020s</span>,
          we have an opportunity to swing back to personal computing power. What
          will this swing look like?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="big-question">
        <p>
          What if we had a Local Personal Web in addition to the World Wide Web?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          Rather than being document-oriented, the Local Personal Web will be
          built around people.

        <h2>Remember</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>hospitality</li>
          <li>people-centered instead of document centered</li>
          <li>consider: does "web" even apply? How might it apply?</li>
          <li>do we need to think about SSL certs and phone companies here?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>A web of people</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I enter your house</li>
          <li>I can leave a token (like a business card)</li>
          <li>
            That token lets people get in contact with me and lets me know where
            they came from
          </li>
          <li>
            I can share that token and tell you "only share this with this group
            of people"
          </li>
          <li>
            do we still need to have something to "do" when we come to the house
            (like chat?)
          </li>
          <li>
            also: has the ability to share information with groups of people
            without them having to explicitly request it (and without publishing
            it publicly)
          </li>
          <li>
