        <h1>Deduction Income</h1>
        <p>
          There's money we all spend on essential things, such as housing, food,
          higher education, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and
          retirement. In the United States, you can deduct some of this off of
          your income taxes, but this can be difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than give people deductions for spending money on things, why
          don't we give everyone the money up front, tax-free?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Give everyone the same benefit</h2>
        <p>
          As of 2020, the
          <a
            href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19500-for-2020-catch-up-limit-rises-to-6500"
            >IRS contribution limit for 401k</a
          >
          retirement accounts is <span class="money">$19,500</span>. While this
          limit is not increased every year, it is increased in
          <span class="money">$500</span>
          increments often enough that we can assume it will someday soon be
          <span class="money">$20,000</span>. (This also turns it into a nice round number.)
        </p>
        <p>
          When you contribute this money, it comes out of your paycheck as a
          pre-tax benefit: that is, it is tax-free income for the year. This is
          great if you have an employer offering 401k accounts and
          <span class="money">$20,000</span> to contribute to the account. If
          you don't have both of these, it's pointless: you're not getting a
          benefit while wealthier people are. Furthermore, even if you have
          access to and means to contribute to a 401k, you have to actively make
          the contribution. If you don't contribute, you don't get the benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of requiring active participation in a 401k plan, we should
          give every adult <span class="money">$20,000</span> a year tax-free in
          monthly installments. Doing so would ensure many things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Everyone would get the benefit.</strong> Without a means
            test, everyone would be getting <span class="money">$20,000</span>,
            no questions asked. This would ensure everyone benefits, not just
            those who can afford to.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The deduction is built-in.</strong> By receiving the money
            tax-free, everyone effectively gains a deduction. There is no need
            to write money off that you're contributing to a retirement account,
            since you're receiving the money underneath anything you've earned.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The benefit will increase over time.</strong> Since everyone
            is receiving the money, there is political support to increase the
            benefit to match inflation.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>What can the money be spent on?</h2>
        <p>
          Anything. This is money that can either be spent on immediate needs or
          invested for retirement. However, the idea is to have
          <span class="money">$20,000</span> that can be spent on needs at
          different stages in life. Consider these scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Turning 18.</strong> The monthly cash starts arriving when
            you turn 18. With this money, you can do the following:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Pay for college</li>
            <li>
              Pay for non-college post-secondary education (e.g.,
              apprenticeship, trade school, career boot camp, etc..)
            </li>
            <li>Find a home to split with roommates</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Finding a first job.</strong> Once you have finished with
            your post-secondary education, you have some cash on hand to live
            off of while you look for a first job.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Saving for a first home.</strong> Once you start your first
            job, you can then save or invest your money so you can put together
            a down payment on a first home.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Invest for retirement.</strong> Since the money is already
            tax-free, you can invest it in a retirement account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Childcare.</strong> Parents of young children can use this
            tax-free money to pay for childcare while working.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unemployment.</strong> If you lose your job or otherwise
            lose income, you are guaranteed this money. No need to prove that
            you have lost your job.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retirement.</strong> Once you retire, you continue to
            receive this money tax free.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How would we pay for this?</h2>
        <p>
          A flat income tax applied before deductions. For most people, this
          would effectively move a portion of their earnings to the untaxed
          deduction income.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tax rate would be determined by the number of adults in the
          country and the total dollar amount of income earned by the entire
          country:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
          (Adults * Deduction Income amount) / Total Income
        </div>

        <p>We can use 2019 numbers to calculate this:</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <a
                href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219"
                >Number of adults over 18:</a
              >
            </td>
            <td class="figure">
              <!-- 
                Under 18 is 22.3, so 77.7% is over 18. 
                328,239,523 * .777 
              -->
              255,042,110
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Proposed Deduction Income amount:</td>
            <td class="figure">$20,000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Total deduction income to pay out:</td>
            <td class="figure">$5.1T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <a
                href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216756/us-personal-income/"
                >Total US Income 2019:</a
              >
            </td>
            <td class="figure">$18.6T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tax rate needed to support Deduction Income:</td>
            <td class="figure"><strong>27.5%</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Under this scenario, the breakeven income level for Deduction Income
          is
          <span class="money">$72,727</span>. That breakeven point will rise and
          fall depending on the tax rate, which depends on the grand total of US
          personal income and the total population. Anyone making less than
          <span class="money">$72,727</span> would be getting more money from
          Deduction Income than they're paying in, while anyone making more than
          this would be contributing towards everyone else's Deduction Income.
          Regardless of personal income, the Deduction Income would always be
          tax free.

        <h2>Isn't this just Universal Basic Income?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes. However, most UBI proposals are for arbitrary amounts (like
          $1000/mo) and rely on revenue streams other than income tax (e.g.,
          mineral rights, wealth taxes, etc...) This proposal uses income tax to
          make it clear where the money is coming from. It also ensures the
          program is not debt-funded. Finally, it is based on the amount allowed
          for tax-free retirement contributions, which will increase over time
          to account for inflation.
