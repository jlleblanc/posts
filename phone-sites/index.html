          Direct dialing over the public telephone network is something we take
          for granted. Up until the 1950's, all phone calls were manually
          connected by operators. When this changed, each country devised their
          dialing plans (including things like area codes), which made local
          phone numbers easy to remember. Of course, these are not as easy to
          remember as domain names, but everyone with a phone got a phone
          number.

            phone number. The country code +1 is followed by the three digit
            area code. The next three digits are the exchange, which are
            specific to a phone company in a local area. The final four digits
            identify the specific phone line.

          Phones in the United States did not change all that much for the next
          30 years or so. Touch-tone dialing was introduced, but that was about
          it.
        </p>
        <p>Then changes started happening quickly.</p>
        <p>
          The phone company was broken up as a part of an antitrust lawsuit.
          Where before phone equipment had to be rented from the phone company,
          any equipment could now be connected to the phone line.
